Project Description

This project is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 to 9 without repetition. The implemented solution effectively identifies valid numbers for each empty cell and iterates through possibilities using recursion and backtracking. Additionally, graphical representations using matplotlib provide clear visual insights into the puzzle's original state and its solution. This project demonstrates the power of algorithmic thinking and visualization to solve complex problems efficiently.
